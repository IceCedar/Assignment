## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

## Problem 1 - Wine Data

### a.Import the data into a data.frame and names each column

```{r}
winedata<-read.table("wine.data",header=FALSE, sep=",")

#covert to data.frame
winedf<-data.frame(winedata)
dim(winedf)
names(winedf)<-c("Class","Alcohol","Malic_acid","Ash","Alcalinity_of_ash","Magnesium","Total_phenols","Flavanoids","Nonflavanoid_phenols","Proanthocyanins","Color_intensity","Hue","OD280/OD315_of_diluted_wines","Proline")
winedf
```

### b. Check the number of wine within each class is equal to the data reported in "wine.names

```{r}
class<-table(winedf$Class)
names(class)<-c("class1","class2","class3")
class
```

### c.use data to answer questions

#### 1.The correlation between alcohol content and color intensity

```{r}
cor(winedf$Alcohol,winedf$Color_intensity)
```

#### 2.Class1 has the highest correlation. Class2 has the lowest correlation.

```{r}
correlation<-c()
for (i in 1:3){
  winedf_byclass<-winedf[winedf$Class==i,]
  correlation[i]<-cor(winedf_byclass$Alcohol,winedf_byclass$Color_intensity)
}
names(correlation)<-c("Class1_rho","Class2_rho","Class3_rho")
correlation

```

#### 3.The alcohol content of the wine with the highest color intensity is 14.34.

```{r}
##Find the highest color intensity.
CImax<-max(winedf$Color_intensity)
alcohol_CImax<-winedf$Alcohol[winedf$Color_intensity==CImax]
c("alcohol conteny"=alcohol_CImax,"highest color intensity"=CImax)
```

#### 4.8.43% wines had a higher content of proanthocyanins compare to ash.

```{r}
wineL<-length(winedf$Class)
wineCompare<-length(winedf$Class[winedf$Proanthocyanins>winedf$Ash])
p<-wineCompare/wineL
p
```

### d.Table for the average value of each variable.

```{r}
ComputeAvg<-function(x){
  average<-c()
  for (i in 2:14){
    avg<-mean(x[,i])
    average<-c(average,avg)
  }
  return(average)
}
averageTotal<-ComputeAvg(winedf)
averageClass1<-ComputeAvg(winedf[winedf$Class==1,])
averageClass2<-ComputeAvg(winedf[winedf$Class==2,])
averageClass3<-ComputeAvg(winedf[winedf$Class==3,])

N<-c("Class","Alcohol","Malic_acid","Ash","Alcalinity_of_ash","Magnesium","Total_phenols","Flavanoids","Nonflavanoid_phenols","Proanthocyanins","Color_intensity","Hue","OD280/OD315_of_diluted_wines","Proline")
Combine<-matrix(c(averageTotal,averageClass1,averageClass2,averageClass3),nrow=4,byrow=TRUE)

Combinedf<-data.frame(Combine)
names(Combinedf)<-names(winedf[,2:14])
rownames(Combinedf)<-c("overall average","average of class 1","average of class 2","average of class 3")
Combinedf
```

### e.Perform t-tests to examine whether the level of phenols differs across the three classes

```{r}
t.test(winedf$Nonflavanoid_phenols[winedf$Class==1],winedf$Nonflavanoid_phenols[winedf$Class==2])
```

Assume the significance level is alpha=0.05. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05. The level of phenols between class 1 and class 2 is not the same.

```{r}
t.test(winedf$Nonflavanoid_phenols[winedf$Class==2],winedf$Nonflavanoid_phenols[winedf$Class==3])
```

Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05. The level of phenols between class 2 and class 3 is not the same.

```{r}
t.test(winedf$Nonflavanoid_phenols[winedf$Class==1],winedf$Nonflavanoid_phenols[winedf$Class==3])
```

Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05. The level of phenols between class 1 and class 3 is not the same.

## Problem 2 - AskManager.org Data

### a.Import the data into a frame

```{r}
askmanager<-read.csv("AskAManager.csv",header=TRUE)
askmanager_df<-data.frame(askmanager)
askmanager_df
```

### b.Simplify the variable names.

```{r}
names(askmanager_df)<-c("X","Timestamp","Age","Occupation","Position","Position_Note","Auual_salary","Compenstion","Currency","Currency_Other","Income_Note","Country","State_US","City","Overall_experience","Field_experience","Education","Gender","Race")
names(askmanager_df)
```

### c.Restrict the data to those being paid in USD.

```{r}
#number of observations before restricting

Nbefore<-length(askmanager_df$X)
AM_US<-askmanager_df[askmanager_df$Currency=="USD",]
Nafter<-length(AM_US$X)

print(paste("the number of observations before restricting data is",Nbefore))
print(paste("the number of observations after restricting data is",Nafter))
```

### d.Eliminate unreasonable age, years of experience in their field, and years of experience total.

```{r}
#Eliminate impossible ages. Taking "65 or over" as retirement age, which can be eliminated.
Elage<-AM_US[AM_US$Age!="65 or over",]

#Eliminate impossible years of experience in their fields. People with "1 year or less" can be seen as beginner, who may not good at their professional work.
Elfield<-Elage[Elage$Field_experience!="1 year or less",]

#Eliminate impossible years of experience total. People with "1 year or less" and "2 - 4 years" may still don't get used to their work.
Eltotal_temp<-Elfield[Elfield$Overall_experience!="1 year or less" ,]
Eltotal<-Eltotal_temp[Eltotal_temp$Overall_experience!="2 - 4 years" ,]

NEltotal<-length(Eltotal$X)
print(paste("the number of observations after eliminating unreasonble data is",NEltotal))
```

### e. Eliminate rows with entremly low and high salaries.

```{r}
#The minimum wage in the US is 7.25$/hr. Assuming the people work full-time for 40 hours week, the annual salary is $15,080. $15,080 is taken as lower bound.
#The annual salary exceeding $150,000 can be deleted.

Ellow<-Eltotal[Eltotal$Auual_salary>15080,]
Elhigh<-Ellow[Ellow$Auual_salary<150000,]
NElhigh<-length(Elhigh$X)

print(paste("the number of observations after eliminating unreasonble income is",NElhigh))
```

### f.Whether there is a statistical association between education and salary, controlling for years of experience.

```{r}
Elhigh$Education=factor(Elhigh$Education)
summary(Elhigh$Education)
levels(Elhigh$Education)=c(1,4,2,5,7,6,3)

Elhigh$Overall_experience=factor(Elhigh$Overall_experience)
summary(Elhigh$Overall_experience)
levels(Elhigh$Overall_experience)=c(3,4,5,6,1,2)

lm1<-lm(Elhigh$Auual_salary~Elhigh$Education+Elhigh$Overall_experience,data=Elhigh)

lm1
```

## Problem 3 - Palindromic Numbers

### a. Write function isPalindromic.

```{r}
isPalindromic<-function(x){
  #x represents an input value
  output<-list()
  #Test whether input value is a positive integer. If the input value is a positive integer, the process will continue.
  if (x%%1==0 & x>0){
    int_reverse=0
    temp=x
    #reverse the number
    while(temp!=0){
      remainder=temp%%10
      int_reverse=int_reverse*10+remainder
      temp=temp%/%10
    }
    #whether the input value is equal to the reverse of their digits.
    if(x==int_reverse){
      output<-list("isPalindromic"=TRUE,"reversed"=x)
    }else{
      warning("The input value is not a palindromic number.")
      output<-list("isPalindromic"=FALSE,"reversed"=int_reverse)
    }
  }else{
    stop("The input value is invalid.")
  }
  return(output)
}
```

### b. Write function nextPalindrome

```{r}
nextPalindrome<-function(x){
  #whether the input value is palindrome.
  temp<-isPalindromic(x)
  if(temp$isPalindromic==TRUE){
    return(x)
  }else{
    while(temp$isPalindromic!=TRUE){
      x=x+1
      suppressWarnings(temp<-isPalindromic(x))
    }
   return(x)
  }
}
```

###c.Find next palindrome for each of following.

```{r}
nextPalindrome(391)
nextPalindrome(9928)
nextPalindrome(19272719)
nextPalindrome(109)
nextPalindrome(2)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
